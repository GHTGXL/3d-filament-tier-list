# 3D Filament Tier List

This project is a simple website that displays a tier list of various 3D printing filaments based on their properties. The information is sourced from the video "The 3D Filament Tier List! Which Should YOU Use?" by Zack Freedman.

## Description

The website categorizes filaments into different tiers (S, A, B, C, F) and provides detailed information about each filament, including its description, pros, cons, and a link to the specific timestamp in the video.
